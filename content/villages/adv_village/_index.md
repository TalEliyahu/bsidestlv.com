# Adversarial Mindset Village

This one's for those with a bit of the outlaw in them. It's all about learning to think like the bad guys, emulating their tactics, techniques, and procedures to fortify your defenses. After all, if you want to catch a bandit, you've got to think like a bandit.


## Adversarial Mindset Village at BsidesTLV 2023

For the first time in BSidesTLV history, we are excited to introduce the Adversarial Mindset Village! This year's event will host various engaging activities designed to immerse attendees in adversary simulation, emulation, malicious mindset, threat intelligence, and purple teaming. We invite you to join us in this groundbreaking initiative and be part of a collaborative effort to shape the future of cybersecurity.

## Our Vision
The Adversarial Mindset is a dynamic and engaging community initiative that's all about Adversary simulation, Adversary Tactics, Life, Adversary Philosophy, Threat Actors Emulation, and Purple Teaming. Our goal is to provide a platform for professionals and enthusiasts to hone their skills and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures to combat modern cyber threats. At BSidesTLV, we'll host technical talks, live demos, panel discussions, and hands-on activities to help you explore the latest tools and techniques in Adversary simulation and Purple teaming and to help you understand better the attackers' mindset and TTP, to create better defensive and offensive capabilities. Whether you're a seasoned cybersecurity pro or just starting out, we've got something for everyone. Join us at the Adversarial Mindset, and let's make a tangible impact on the cybersecurity world together!


### Opening Session: Becoming A Better Adversary
**Gal Bitansky**
We can always learn a new trick, unlock a new achievement - or just get better. This talk will discuss the complex relationship with defenders and how it can make you a better person (by assisting them to better prepare for a real adversary) and a better red teamer (by learning their limitations). We will provide concrete scenarios and practical lessons from our personal experience.

He likes to share his thoughts and experiments on-stage using simple concepts and tools to demonstrate surprising results. Some of his previous work contains an evasion technique for sandboxes, a proof-of-concept malware built purely in copy-paste, and a free update-able vaccination framework.

### A ransomware battle royal: The cybersecurity battle you can't afford to lose
**By  Danna Pelleg, Sharon Fisher**
In this "Ransomware Battle Royal" session, we will explore the different motivations behind these attacks, such as financial gain through Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and geopolitical motives of various groups. We will also discuss the high-level kill chain of a destructive ransomware attack and the various techniques used in these attacks, including real-life examples. Through this session, attendees will better understand the latest tactics ransomware attackers use and learn how to protect their businesses from these dangerous threats. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, a business owner, or simply interested in the evolving threat landscape, this session is a must-attend. Join us for an informative and engaging discussion on the cybersecurity battle you can't afford to lose.

### Keynote: Red Team Tales: 7 Years of Physical Penetration Testing 
**By: Justin Wynn**
Have you ever wondered how physical penetration tests are conducted? What it would be like to actually rob a bank or how someone can gain access to the most physically secure buildings in existence? Is it really as easy as walking through the front door and asking to visit the server closet, or are people creeping in at the middle of the night, face painted, wearing tactile-necks? The answer is YES. 
In this exclusive presentation, I'll be covering 7 action-packed years of physical penetration tests, with stories of breaking into banks, water treatment facilities, skyscrapers in NYC, courthouses in Iowa, and cheese-packing facilities in the middle of nowhere. We'll turn everything you know about physical security upside down - case in point, the cheese factory was by far the most secure. I'll show you how we did it, the characters we met along the way, and share some of the greatest never before told stories.

Bio: Justin Wynn is a Director at Coalfire who specializes in physical security and regularly performs network, application, wireless, and social engineering penetration tests. You may be familiar with his wrongful arrest while testing courthouses in Iowa. He's Keynoted conferences and conducted over 350 penetration tests and physical engagements. His past times include bank robbing, critical infrastructure parkour, and inventing new tools+techniques for physical security. @redteamwynns

### AI Red Teaming LLM's
